# Selection Sort Visualization

This project visualizes the **Selection Sort** algorithm using Java's `Swing` and `AWT` libraries. It demonstrates how the algorithm sorts a shuffled array of integers through animated swaps, allowing users to observe the process step by step.

## Features

- **Real-time Sorting Animation**: View each swap as the Selection Sort algorithm sorts the array.
- **Randomized Input**: The array is shuffled before each sort, making each run unique.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Developed using `JFrame` and `JPanel` for a simple and clear visual representation.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
  - Swing (for GUI)
  - AWT (for graphics)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SelectionSortVisualizer.git
